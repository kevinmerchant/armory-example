# Overview

This tutorial is designed to serve as a quick introduction to performing adaptive attacks in ARMORY.  As a result, we will present simple examples to demonstrate each concept, focusing on *how* an attack would be implemented in ARMORY, rather than focusing on attack strength or sophistication.

For a more comprehensive introduction to adaptive attack techniques, we recommend [On Adaptive Attacks to Adversarial Example Defenses](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.08347.pdf).
